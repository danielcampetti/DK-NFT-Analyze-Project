Analyze data from NFTs, for specific collections at Opensea

API app to analyze data from NFTs, for specific collections. In order to filter out specific characteristics of NFTs. I don't consider it a BOT program because it doesn't integrate elements for it, however it will analyze the characteristic data from the NFT collections. The intention is to better understand the collections by studying the macro and micro characteristics of each NFT.
